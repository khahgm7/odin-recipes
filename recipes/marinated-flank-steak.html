        <h2>What Is Flank Steak?</h2>
        <p><span class="highlight">Flank steak</span> is a lean cut of beef that comes from the cow's lower abdominal muscles. It's a relatively tough cut that's low in fat, which means a few things: <span class="highlight">Flank steak</span> doesn't need to be trimmed, it's inexpensive compared to other cuts, and it benefits greatly from marination.</p>

            <h3><span class="highlight">Flank steak</span> vs. Skirt Steak</h3>
            <p>Flank and skirt steaks are similar in a lot of ways, but they do have notable differences. Skirt steak comes from the diaphragm of the cow, while <span class="highlight">Flank steak</span> comes from the lower abdomen. Also, skirt steak is fattier and has more marbling than <span class="highlight">Flank steak</span>. <span class="highlight">Flank steak</span> is thicker and wider.</p>

            <h3>Flank Steak Substitute</h3>
            <p>No <span class="highlight">Flank steak</span>? No problem. Skirt steak is a great substitute. Top round and hanger steak are also excellent options.</p>
        
        <h2>Flank Steak Marinade</h2>
        <p>This crowd-pleasing <span class="highlight">Flank steak</span> marinade consists of the following ingredients: vegetable oil, soy sauce, red wine vinegar, lemon juice, Worcestershire sauce, Dijon mustard, garlic, and ground black pepper.</p>
        <p>As long as you marinate the <span class="highlight">Flank steak</span> in the fridge for two to six hours, you'll have great results. However, for the absolute best results, marinate overnight or up to 12 hours.</p>

        <h2>How to Cook Flank Steak</h2>
        <p>There are plenty of ways to perfectly cook a <span class="highlight">Flank steak</span>. In this recipe, the steak is grilled — we love the bold, smoky flavor the grill gives the meat. But you can also easily cook your <span class="highlight">Flank steak</span> in the oven or on the stove. You'll find the step-by-step recipe for marinated and grilled <span class="highlight">Flank steak</span> below, but here are some rough guidelines for three different <span class="highlight">Flank steak</span> cooking methods:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>On the grill</strong>: Season and marinate the steak according to your recipe. Preheat a lightly oiled outdoor grill to medium-high heat. Remove the steak from the marinade, shake off excess liquid, and grill on each side to desired doneness. The steak is done when a meat thermometer inserted into the center reads between 130 degrees F and 145 degrees F.</li>
            <li><strong>In the oven</strong>: Season and marinate the steak according to your recipe. Remove the steak from the marinade, shake off excess liquid, and arrange the steaks in a baking dish lined with aluminum foil. Bake until a meat thermometer inserted into the center of the steak reads between 130 degrees F and 145 degrees F.</li>
            <li><strong>On the stove</strong>: Season and marinate the steak according to your recipe. Sear the steaks in a cast-iron skillet until lightly browned on the bottom, then flip to the other side and repeat. Finish the steaks in a preheated oven. Bake until a meat thermometer inserted into the center of the steak reads between 130 degrees F and 145 degrees F.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>How Long to Cook a Flank Steak</h2>
        <p>It depends on the degree of doneness you're after. This marinated <span class="highlight">Flank steak</span> should be totally cooked after about 5 minutes of grilling time on each side. Of course, tastes and preferences will vary.</p>

        <h2>Allrecipes Community Tips and Praise</h2>
        <p>"I've made this twice and it was wonderful both times," says gertrong. "Each time I marinated the meat for 24 hours and ended up with a wonderful flavor and very tender meat."</p>
        <p>"Easy to prepare and pretty tender," according to one Allrecipes community member. "As another reviewer suggested, I boiled the remaining marinade until it thickened into a nice sauce and drizzled a little over the meat and added some butter sauteed mushrooms. Looked fancy and tasted wonderful!"</p>
        <p>"This recipe was so easy and tasted FANTASTIC," raves DUBYANGE. "I always love to marinade meat in Italian dressing but this takes the cake. Luckily we ate it all because if there was any left, I would have kept eating it. Way to go on this easy, great tasting recipe. I wouldn't change a thing."</p>
